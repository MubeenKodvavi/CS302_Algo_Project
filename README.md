A graphical user interface to run several dynamic programming problems
and obtain their results.

> This repository is a submission for course project for CS302 offered at FAST NUCES.

## Language and Libraries used

This application is built with Python language and Tkinter library from Python is used for making GUI.

## How to run

Run following command with python installed from terminal while in the project directory:

```bash
python App.py
```

## Flow of program

- User selects an algorithm that he wants to run from the list.![Landing page](https://github.com/MubeenKodvavi/CS302_Algo_Project/blob/master/screenshots/LandingPage.png)
- He selects whether to run sample file( generated by script in sample test cases folder) or chose his own file on the algorithm.![Select file page](https://github.com/MubeenKodvavi/CS302_Algo_Project/blob/master/screenshots/SelectFilePage.png)
- A result of the algorithm along with algorithm name, input and output data is shown in a new window.![Results page](https://github.com/MubeenKodvavi/CS302_Algo_Project/blob/master/screenshots/ResultsPage.png)
